### Some Important notes:

- Please know that I use python venv while doing this. There might be differences with your installed library. Although this project is straighforward, it should not cause much issue.
- All you need for the dependencies library is in the requirements.txt
- if you want to use, please make sure you use your own google form link. Otherwise it will not work
- if you want to use, please make sure you use your own chrome drive path
- make sure to know if your chrome version is compatible with your chromedriver version. otherwise, it will introduce error! 

### How to install:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to use:

PLEASE NOTE: it needs 1 command after the filename!

```
python automate_form.py
```
